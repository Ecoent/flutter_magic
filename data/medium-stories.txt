Hi there! this is a storie about a new app, API Explorer, built on top of Flutter and Firebase.

= Overview =
API Explorer's target is to provide a tool somewhere between low and highlevel to visualize the data in an API. 

Think about a data API that provides a few URLs to get a sample of raw data that interests you.
Eg:
    * https://www.theaudiodb.com, "TheAudioDB is a community run database of Music Artwork, Metadata, Charts, Events, Music Videos and File Hashes, with free access via our front-end Website or back-end JSON API". 
    * Info about an artist -> https://www.theaudiodb.com/api/v1/json/1/search.php?s=the%20beatles
    * Albums by an artist -> https://www.theaudiodb.com/api/v1/json/1/searchalbum.php?s=the%20beatles)

Well, API Explorer allows anyone to go from raw data to this:

The same idea is applicable to more APIs of different kind of information

Can you see the pattern? All the samples follow the same design!

Wait: but what if data doesn't follow this structure?
    Well, the template is flexible, did you notice that Mars' screenshot doesn't have a description? what about the tags? 
    Also, there are a few templates more, each one suitable for a different use case, and it's even possible to link several templates to one data API.

Under the hood
    It all starts with a public data API:
        https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/api-explorer-app/planets/planets.json
    
    API Explorer reads & parses it




Enter the template model

    At first API Explorer only needs a data API EndPoint

* Templates ('detail', 'compare', 'hero', 'match')
